"Yes","Yes","Yes","I tend to go to the gym more often when someone is holding me accountable, be it a workout buddy or a personal trainer. This would be an alternative to that, having someone at an organization expecting me would be a great motivator. I really like the idea."
"No","Yes","Yes",""
"Yes","Yes","Yes","The dog example is extra interesting because you could probably bring in money on both ends."
"Yes","No","No","Would my money go towards the non-profits as well or to run the business?"
"No","Yes","Yes","I would potentially pay for it but not sure about flexibility and the money may now be used by me. For instance if I go to the gym early or late after work I fit it into my schedule. If I volunteer, are there things in the morning or night to workout, during the week. There are things on the weekend in sure, etc. I would also ensure the social aspect of working out and getting to know people in the community while helping to create and Forster the community"
"No","No","No","Comment 1: This sounds like a great idea, but I don't think it would work for me.  I went to a gym to do specific exercises my PT game me to manage a herniated disc.  I should go back, but time has been tight (hence 'no' for the last two questions).  I personally have a need to use specific machines with known weights.

Comment 2: This sounds a little like paying for the opportunity to do volunteer work.  Is there a fitness/training/supervision component that someone just volunteering their time wouldn't get that this program provides for the the monthly fee?"
"No","No","No","I love the idea but I was un-decided on the ""is this something you would pay for"" question.

I would pay for this sort of service, to help organize events. However the 2 examples provided seem more along the lines of helping community or local organization projects that already have a budget of some sort. If I'm being lined up to work, then it seems the organization should be helping do that, or at least I wouldn't expect to pay to be lined up for free labor.

However, if it was very well executed I might easily change my mind. (e.g. when I get to the location to help build a park path, I don't want to be figuring out who I need to talk to or what I need to do in order to help / exercise.)"
"Yes","Yes","No",""
"No","No","No","There should have been a choice of maybe with the first question. I would need much more info before I agreed to something like this. Overall I like the concept.

(got from other item) - I already answered with these same choices once already. So sorry about that. What couldn't I find things to do like this and simply volunteer. Then I wouldn't be paying to do good and get some activity as well? I have more questions like this which is the reason I said no to the first question. Thanks

In addition to Habitat, many cities have Clean Sweep Days, and local colleges and universities have student led community service activities for neighborhood cleanup, community garden planting and maintenance,  girls and boys club maintenance, veteran services physical plant maintenance, transitional housing maintenance, etc."

"Yes","No","Yes","Interesting new take on working out and helping your community."
"Yes","","","I would consider paying depending on how much goes back to the charities.  Right now I could go to the SPCA and walk dogs and not have to pay them to do that. If I were looking at the social aspect of this and I were new to an area and wanted to meet people, it might be a good idea."

"No","Yes","Yes","I do very specific workouts and I'm not sure that I'd get those routines done through regular labor."
"No","No","No","I have 3 kids who are active in sports that I either coach or help participate in which keeps me very active. Paying to volunteer is not a great option in my opinion! Hikes are free and there are plenty of meet ups that are free to join. Your survey should have a few demographic question to cross tab against answers! You should also ask if you have a home gym as I have a eliptical as well as weights at home!"

"Yes","No","No","I love the idea of doing work with my body that has a benefit other than just getting in shape.  The gym always felt like a hamster wheel, and made it hard to stick to.

I would pay for this, but not much -- I feel like if this is affilated with volunteer work that I'm providing value to the recipient, and the ""workout"" is a side-effect.  That being said, I respect the overhead of organizing and marketing, so I don't mind paying to support something that helps get me off my butt."
"No","No","Yes","I don't pay for a gym membership, however I inadvertently do through my student fees at the University at Buffalo. I believe its called a ""gym fee"" in my tuition."
"Yes","No","Yes","This sounds like an awesome idea. I pay $20/session at a gym for a personal trainer but I would much rather train outside or while doing an activity, not to mention have a chance to give back."

"No","No","Yes","I think the concept of replacing the gym should be dropped. There are plenty of people who do not go to the gym and could use exercise. You should target them instead of the people already working out, because people who go to the gym have routines and schedules that focus on specific things for that day. There's no isometrics in labor. But the goal of getting the community to exercise through volunteer work is wonderful, so good lucl"
"No","Yes","Yes","Maybe this could be a hiring program in part. Say people worked out by helping construct something. A construction company could handle the training for the day and then make people job offers if they saw anyone they liked."

"No","Yes","Yes","While these seem like good/fun things to do, they definitely would not replace my gym workouts, but could be a supplement to it.  They also don't sound like things I'd pay for, even if someone was there to 'coach' proper dog walking technique. Maybe if it was pitched in a different way - not as a gym alternative, but as a great way to build a community of active people, and what you're paying for is someone to organize/administer everything and a happy by-product is a healthier community."

"No","No","Yes","Since you offer programs that directly affect communities you are likely on a not for profit space that can seek government and municipal subsidy.  

Depending on the types of labor/ workout you plan on organizing, you may need to answer to labor and construction regs and have proper lisence for that.

Be able to answer how you plan on getting people signed up and involved.  App and website seem like the obvious way to go.  However, strategic partnerships with local government offices or other civic service businesses such as the tool library can offer a good place for users to sign up and learn more.

Keep in mind that these activities are not the same as a proper gym workout, however labor related exercise offer a unique set of other physical benefits (sell those).

Good luck with startup NY.  I have experience with this program and other such programs. Reach me at shane@buffautomation.com to discuss."
